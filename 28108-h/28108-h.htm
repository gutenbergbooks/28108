<p>ight Honorable, and worthy honoured Lord, as in my Travels, I
was entertained, welcomed, and relieved by many Honourable Lords,
Worshipful Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen, and others both in
England and Scotland. So now your Lordship's inclination hath
incited, or invited my poor muse to shelter herself under the
shadow of your honorable patronage, not that there is any worth
at all in my sterile invention, but in all humility I acknowledge
that it is only your Lordship's acceptance, that is able to make
this nothing, something, and withal engage me ever.</p>

ist Lordlings, list (if you have
lust to list)<br />
I write not here a tale of had I wist:<br />
But you shall hear of travels, and relations,<br />
Descriptions of strange (yet English) fashions.<br />
And he that not believes what here is writ,<br />
Let him (as I have done) make proof of it.<br />
The year of grace, accounted (as I ween)<br />
One thousand twice three hundred and eighteen,<br />
And to relate all things in order duly,<br />
'Twas Tuesday last, the fourteenth day of July,<br />
Saint <i>Revels</i> day, the almanack will tell ye<br />
The sign in <i>Virgo</i> was, or near the belly:<br />
The moon full three days old, the wind full south;<br />
At these times I began this trick of youth.<br />
I speak not of the tide, for understand,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg
2]</a></span>My legs I made my oars, and rowed by land,<br />
Though in the morning I began to go<br />
Good fellows trooping, flocked me so,<br />
That make what haste I could, the sun was set,<br />
E're from the gates of <i>London</i> I could get.<br />
At last I took my latest leave thus late,<br />
At the Bell Inn, that's <i>extra Aldersgate</i>.<br />
There stood a horse that my provant<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
"FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> should carry,<br />
From that place to the end of my fegary,<a name="FNanchor_2_2"
id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a><br />
My horse no horse, or mare, but gelded nag,<br />
That with good understanding bore my bag:<br />
And of good carriage he himself did show,<br />
These things are excellent in a beast you know.<br />
There in my knapsack, (to pay hunger's fees)<br />
I had good bacon, biscuit, neat's-tongue, cheese<br />
With roses, barberries, of each conserves,<br />
And mithridate, that vigorous health perserves:<br />
And I entreat you take these words for no-lies,<br />
I had good <i>Aqua vit&aelig;, Rosa</i> so-lies:<br />
With sweet <i>Ambrosia</i>, (the gods' own drink)<br />
Most excellent gear for mortals, as I think,<br />
Besides, I had both vinegar and oil,<br />
That could a daring saucy stomach foil.<br />
This foresaid Tuesday night 'twixt eight and nine,<br />
Well rigged and ballasted, both with beer and wine,<br />
I stumbling forward, thus my jaunt begun,<br />
And went that night as far as <i>Islington</i>.<br />
There did I find (I dare affirm it bold)<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg
3]</a></span>A Maidenhead of twenty-five years old,<br />
But surely it was painted, like a whore,<br />
And for a sign, or wonder, hanged at door,<br />
Which shows a Maidenhead, that's kept so long,<br />
May be hanged up, and yet sustain no wrong.<br />
There did my loving friendly host begin<br />
To entertain me freely to his inn:<br />
And there my friends, and good associates,<br />
Each one to mirth himself accommodates.<br />
<i>At Well-head</i> both for welcome, and for cheer,<br />
Having a good <i>New ton</i>, of good stale beer:<br />
There did we <i>Trundle</i>[3] down health, after health,<br />
(Which oftentimes impairs both health and wealth.)<br />
Till everyone had filled his mortal trunk,<br />
And only <i>No-body</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id=
"FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> was three parts drunk.<br />
The morrow next, Wednesday Saint <i>Swithin's</i> day,<br />
From ancient <i>Islington</i> I took my way.<br />
At <i>Holywell</i> I was enforced carouse,<br />
Ale high, and mighty, at the Blindman's House.<br />
But there's a help to make amends for all,<br />
That though the ale be great, the pots be small.<br />
At <i>Highgate</i> Hill to a strange house I went,<br />
And saw the people were to eating bent,<br />
In either borrowed, craved, asked, begged, or bought,<br />
But most laborious with my teeth I wrought.<br />
I did not this, 'cause meat or drink was scant,<br />
But I did practise thus before my want;<br />
Like to a Tilter that would win the prize,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg
4]</a></span>Before the day he'll often exercise.<br />
So I began to put in use, at first<br />
These principles 'gainst hunger, 'gainst thirst.<br />
Close to the Gate,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id=
"FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> there dwelt a worthy man,<br />
That well could take his whiff, and quaff his can,<br />
Right Robin Good-fellow, but humours evil,<br />
Do call him <i>Robin Pluto</i>, or the devil.<br />
But finding him a devil, freely hearted,<br />
With friendly farewells I took leave and parted,<br />
And as alongst I did my journey take,<br />
I drank at <i>Broom's well</i>, for pure fashion's sake,<br />
Two miles I travelled then without a bait,<br />
The Saracen's Head at <i>Whetstone</i> entering straight,<br />
I found an host, that might lead an host of men,<br />
Exceeding fat, yet named <i>Lean</i>, and <i>Fen</i>.<a name=
"FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br />
And though we make small reckoning of him here,<br />
He's known to be a very great man there.<br />
There I took leave of all my company,<br />
Bade all farewell, yet spake to <i>No-body</i>.<br />
Good reader think not strange, what I compile,<br />
For <i>No-body</i> was with me all this while.<br />
And <i>No-body</i> did drink, and, wink, and scink,<br />
And on occasion freely spent his chink.<br />
If anyone desire to know the man,<br />
Walk, stumble, <i>Trundle</i>, but in <i>Barbican</i>.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg
5]</a></span>There's as good beer and ale as ever twang'd,<br />
And in that street kind <i>No-body</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id=
"FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> is hanged.<br />
But leaving him unto his matchless fame,<br />
I to St. <i>Albans</i> in the evening came,<br />
Where Master <i>Taylor</i>, at the Saracen's Head,<br />
Unasked (unpaid for) me both lodged and fed.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg
6]</a></span>The tapsters, hostlers, chamberlains, and all,<br />
Saved me a labour, that I need not call,<br />
The jugs were filled and filled, the cups went round,<br />
And in a word great kindness there I found,<br />
For which both to my cousin, and his men,<br />
I'll still be thankful in word, deed, and pen.<br />
Till Thursday morning there I made my stay,<br />
And then I went plain <i>Dunstable</i> highway.<br />
My very heart with drought methought did shrink,<br />
I went twelve miles, and no one bade me drink.<br />
Which made me call to mind, that instant time,<br />
That drunkenness was a most sinful crime.<br />
When <i>Puddle-hill</i> I footed down, and past<br />
A mile from thence, I found a hedge at last.<br />
There stroke we sail, our bacon, cheese, and bread,<br />
We drew like fiddlers, and like farmers fed.<br />
And whilst two hours we there did take our ease,<br />
My nag made shift to mump green pulse<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id=
"FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> and peas.<br />
Thus we our hungry stomachs did supply,<br />
And drank the water of a brook hard by.<br />
Away toward <i>Hockley</i> in the Hole, we make,<br />
When straight a horseman did me overtake,<br />
Who knew me, and would fain have given me coin,<br />
I said, my bonds did me from coin enjoin,<br />
I thanked and prayed him to put up his chink,<br />
And willingly I wished it drowned in drink.<br />
Away rode he, but like an honest man,<br />
I found at <i>Hockley</i> standing at the Swan,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg
7]</a></span>A formal tapster, with a jug and glass,<br />
Who did arrest me: I most willing was<br />
To try the action, and straight put in bail,<br />
My fees were paid before, with sixpence ale,<br />
To quit this kindness, I most willing am,<br />
The man that paid for all, his name is <i>Dam</i>,<br />
At the Green Dragon, against <i>Grays-Inn</i> gate,<br />
He lives in good repute, and honest state.<br />
I forward went in this my roving race,<br />
To <i>Stony Stratford</i> I toward night did pace,<br />
My mind was fixed through the town to pass,<br />
To find some lodging in the hay or grass,<br />
But at the <i>Queen's Arms</i>, from the window there,<br />
A comfortable voice I chanced to hear,<br />
Call <i>Taylor, Taylor</i>, and be hanged come hither,<br />
I looked for small entreaty and went thither,<br />
There were some friends, which I was glad to see,<br />
Who knew my journey; lodged, and boarded me.<br />
On Friday morn, as I would take my way,<br />
My friendly host entreated me to stay,<br />
Because it rained, he told me I should have<br />
Meat, drink, and horse-meat and not pay or crave.<br />
I thanked him, and for his love remain his debtor,<br />
But if I live, I will requite him better.<br />
(From <i>Stony Stratford</i>) the way hard with stones,<br />
Did founder me, and vex me to the bones.<br />
In blustering weather, both for wind and rain,<br />
Through <i>Towcester</i> I trotted with much pain,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg
8]</a></span>Two miles from thence, we sat us down and
dined,<br />
Well bulwarked by a hedge, from rain and wind.<br />
We having fed, away incontinent,<br />
With weary pace toward <i>Daventry</i> we went.<br />
Four miles short of it, one o'ertook me there,<br />
And told me he would leave a jug of beer,<br />
At <i>Daventry</i> at the Horse-shoe for my use.<br />
I thought it no good manners to refuse,<br />
But thanked him, for his kind unasked gift,<br />
Whilst I was lame as scarce a leg could lift,<br />
Came limping after to that stony town,<br />
Whose hard streets made me almost halt right down.<br />
There had my friend performed the words he said,<br />
And at the door a jug of liquor staid,<br />
The folks were all informed, before I came,<br />
How, and wherefore my journey I did frame,<br />
Which caused mine hostess from her door come out,<br />
(Having a great wart rampant on her snout.)<br />
The tapsters, hostlers, one another call,<br />
The chamberlains with admiration all,<br />
Were filled with wonder, more than wonderful,<br />
As if some monster sent from the <i>Mogul</i>,<br />
Some elephant from <i>Africa</i>, I had been,<br />
Or some strange beast from the <i>Amazonian</i> Queen.<br />
As buzzards, widgeons, woodcocks, and such fowl,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg
9]</a></span>Do gaze and wonder at the broad-faced owl,<br />
So did these brainless asses, all amazed,<br />
With admirable <i>Nonsense</i> talked and gazed,<br />
They knew my state (although not told by me)<br />
That I could scarcely go, they all could see,<br />
They drank of my beer, that to me was given,<br />
But gave me not a drop to make all even,<br />
And that which in my mind was most amiss,<br />
My hostess she stood by and saw all this,<br />
Had she but said, come near the house my friend,<br />
For this day here shall be your journey's end.<br />
Then had she done the thing which [she] did not,<br />
And I in kinder words had paid the shot.<br />
I do entreat my friends, (as I have some)<br />
If they to <i>Daventry</i> do chance to come,<br />
That they will baulk that inn; or if by chance,<br />
Or accident into that house they glance,<br />
Kind gentlemen, as they by you reap profit,<br />
My hostess care of me, pray tell her of it,<a name="FNanchor_8_8"
id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class=
"fnanchor">[8]</a><br />
Yet do not neither; lodge there when you will,<br />
You for your money shall be welcome still.<br />
From thence that night, although my bones were sore,<br />
I made a shift to hobble seven miles more:<br />
The way to <i>Dunchurch</i>, foul with dirt and mire,<br />
Able, I think, both man and horse to tire.<br />
On <i>Dunsmoor</i> Heath, a hedge doth there enclose<br />
Grounds, on the right hand, there I did repose.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg
10]</a></span>Wit's whetstone, Want, there made us quickly
learn,<br />
With knives to cut down rushes, and green fern,<br />
Of which we made a field-bed in the field,<br />
Which sleep, and rest, and much content did yield.<br />
There with my mother earth, I thought it fit<br />
To lodge, and yet no incest did commit:<br />
My bed was curtained with good wholesome airs,<br />
And being weary, I went up no stairs:<br />
The sky my canopy, bright <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> shined<br />
Sweet bawling <i>Zephyrus</i> breathed gentle wind,<br />
In heaven's star-chamber I did lodge that night,<br />
Ten thousand stars, me to my bed did light;<br />
There barricadoed with a bank lay we<br />
Below the lofty branches of a tree,<br />
There my bed-fellows and companions were,<br />
My man, my horse, a bull, four cows, two steer:<br />
But yet for all this most confused rout,<br />
We had no bed-staves, yet we fell not out.<br />
Thus nature, like an ancient free upholster,<br />
Did furnish us with bedstead, bed, and bolster;<br />
And the kind skies, (for which high heaven be thanked,)<br />
Allowed us a large covering and a blanket;<br />
<i>Auroras</i> face 'gan light our lodging dark,<br />
We arose and mounted, with the mounting lark,<br />
Through plashes, puddles, thick, thin, wet and dry,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg
11]</a></span>I travelled to the city <i>Coventry</i>.<br />
There Master Doctor <i>Holland</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id=
"FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a> caused me stay<br />
The day of <i>Saturn</i> and the Sabbath day.<br />
Most friendly welcome, he me did afford,<br />
I was so entertained at bed and board,<br />
Which as I dare not brag how much it was,<br />
I dare not be ingrate and let it pass,<br />
But with thanks many I remember it,<br />
(Instead of his good deeds) in words and writ,<br />
He used me like his son, more than a friend,<br />
And he on Monday his commends did send<br />
To <i>Newhall</i>, where a gentleman did dwell,<br />
Who by his name is hight <i>Sacheverell</i>.<br />
The Tuesday <i>July's</i> one and twentieth day,<br />
I to the city <i>Lichfield</i> took my way,<br />
At <i>Sutton Coldfield</i> with some friends I met,<br />
And much ado I had from thence to get,<br />
There I was almost put unto my trumps,<br />
My horse's shoes were worn as thin as pumps;<br />
But noble <i>Vulcan</i>, a mad smuggy smith,<br />
All reparations me did furnish with.<br />
The shoes were well removed, my palfrey shod,<br />
And he referred the payment unto God.<br />

12]</a></span>I found a friend, when I to <i>Lichfield</i>
came,<br />
A joiner, and <i>John Piddock</i> is his name.<br />
He made me welcome, for he knew my jaunt,<br />
And he did furnish me with good provant:<br />
He offered me some money, I refused it,<br />
And so I took my leave, with thanks excused it,<br />
That Wednesday, I a weary way did pass,<br />
Rain, wind, stones, dirt, and dabbling dewy grass,<br />
With here and there a pelting scattered village,<br />
Which yielded me no charity, or pillage:<br />
For all the day, nor yet the night that followed.<br />
One drop of drink I'm sure my gullet swallowed.<br />
At night I came to a stony town called <i>Stone</i>.<br />
Where I knew none, nor was I known of none:<br />
I therefore through the streets held on my pace,<br />
Some two miles farther to some resting place:<br />
At last I spied a meadow newly mowed,<br />
The hay was rotten, the ground half o'erflowed:<br />
We made a breach, and entered horse and man,<br />
There our pavilion, we to pitch began,<br />
Which we erected with green broom and hay,<br />
To expel the cold, and keep the rain away;<br />
The sky all muffled in a cloud 'gan lower,<br />
And presently there fell a mighty shower,<br />
Which without intermission down did pour,<br />
From ten a night, until the morning's four.<br />
We all that time close in our couch did lie,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg
13]</a></span>Which being well compacted kept us dry.<br />
The worst was, we did neither sup nor sleep,<br />
And so a temperate diet we did keep.<br />
The morning all enrobed in drifting fogs,<br />
We being as ready as we had been dogs:<br />
We need not stand upon long ready making,<br />
But gaping, stretching, and our ears well shaking:<br />
And for I found my host and hostess kind,<br />
I like a true man left my sheets behind.<br />
That Thursday morn, my weary course I framed,<br />
Unto a town that is <i>Newcastle</i> named.<br />
(Not that <i>Newcastle</i> standing upon <i>Tyne</i>)<br />
But this town situation doth confine<br />
Near <i>Cheshire</i>, in the famous county <i>Stafford</i>,<br />
And for their love, I owe them not a straw for't;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now my versing muse craves
some repose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And whilst she sleeps I'll spout
a little prose.</span><br /></p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">In this town of <i>Newcastle</i>,
I overtook an hostler, and I asked him what the next town was
called, that was in my way toward <i>Lancaster</i>, he holding
the end of a riding rod in his mouth, as if it had been a flute,
piped me this answer, and said, <i>Talk-on-the-Hill</i>; I asked
him again what he said <i>Talk-on-the-Hill</i>: I demanded the
third time, and the third time he answered me as he did before,
<i>Talk-on-the-Hill</i>. I began to grow choleric, and asked him
why he could not talk, or tell me my way as well there as on the
hill; at last I was resolved, that the next town was four miles
off me, and that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id=
"Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> name of it was,
<i>Talk-on-the-Hill</i>: I had not travelled above two miles
farther: but my last night's supper (which was as much as
nothing) my mind being informed of it by my stomach. I made a
virtue of necessity, and went to breakfast in the Sun: I have
fared better at three Suns many times before now, in
<i>Aldersgate Street</i>, <i>Cripplegate</i>, and new <i>Fish
Street</i>; but here is the odds, at those Suns they will come
upon a man with a tavern bill as sharp cutting as a tailor's bill
of items: a watchman's-bill, or a welsh-hook falls not half so
heavy upon a man; besides, most of the vintners have the law in
their own hands, and have all their actions, cases, bills of
debt, and such reckonings tried at their own bars; from whence
there is no appeal. But leaving these impertinences, in the
material Sunshine, we eat a substantial dinner, and like
miserable guests we did budget up the reversions.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8.5em;">And now with sleep my muse hath
eased her brain<br />
I'll turn my style from prose, to verse again.<br />
That which we could not have, we freely spared,<br />
And wanting drink, most soberly we fared.<br />
We had great store of fowl (but 'twas foul way)<br />
And kindly every step entreats me stay,<br />
The clammy clay sometimes my heels would trip,<br />
One foot went forward, the other back would slip,<br />
This weary day, when I had almost past,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg
15]</a></span>I came unto Sir <i>Urian Leigh's</i> at last,<br />
At <i>Adlington</i>, near <i>Macclesfield</i> he doth
dwell,<br />
Beloved, respected, and reputed well.<br />
Through his great love, my stay with him was fixed,<br />
From Thursday night, till noon on Monday next,<br />
At his own table I did daily eat,<br />
Whereat may be supposed, did want no meat,<br />
He would have given me gold or silver either,<br />
But I, with many thanks, received neither,<br />
And thus much without flattery I dare swear,<br />
He is a knight beloved far and near,<br />
First he's beloved of his God above,<br />
(Which love he loves to keep, beyond all love)<br />
Next with a wife and children he is blest,<br />
Each having God's fear planted in their breast.<br />
With fair demaines, revenue of good lands,<br />
He's fairly blessed by the Almighty's hands,<br />
And as he's happy in these outward things,<br />
So from his inward mind continual springs<br />
Fruits of devotion, deeds of piety,<br />
Good hospitable works of charity,<br />
Just in his actions, constant in his word,<br />
And one that won his honour with the sword,<br />
He's no carranto, cap'ring, carpet knight,<br />
But he knows when, and how to speak or fight,<br />
I cannot flatter him, say what I can,<br />
He's every way a complete gentleman.<br />
I write not this, for what he did to me,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg
16]</a></span>But what mine ears, and eyes did hear and
see,<br />
Nor do I pen this to enlarge his fame<br />
But to make others imitate the same,<br />
For like a trumpet were I pleased to blow,<br />
I would his worthy worth more amply show,<br />
But I already fear have been too bold,<br />
And crave his pardon, me excused to hold.<br />
Thanks to his sons and servants every one,<br />
Both males and females all, excepting none.<br />
To bear a letter he did me require,<br />
Near <i>Manchester</i>, unto a good Esquire:<br />
His kinsman <i>Edmund Prestwitch</i>, he ordained,<br />
That I was at <i>Manchester</i> entertained<br />
Two nights, and one day, ere we thence could pass,<br />
For men and horse, roast, boiled, and oats, and grass;<br />
This gentleman not only gave harbour,<br />
But in the morning sent me to his barber,<br />
Who laved, and shaved me, still I spared my purse,<br />
Yet sure he left me many a hair the worse.<br />
But in conclusion, when his work was ended,<br />
His glass informed, my face was much amended.<br />
And for the kindness he to me did show,<br />
God grant his customers beards faster grow,<br />
That though the time of year be dear or cheap,<br />
From fruitful faces he may mow and reap.<br />
Then came a smith, with shoes, and tooth and nail,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg
17]</a></span>He searched my horse's hoofs, mending what did
fail,<br />
Yet this I note, my nag, through stones and dirt,<br />
Did shift shoes twice, ere I did shift one shirt:<br />
Can these kind things be in oblivion hid?<br />
No, Master <i>Prestwitch</i>, this and much more did,<br />
His friendship did command and freely gave<br />
All before writ, and more than I durst crave.<br />
But leaving him a little, I must tell,<br />
How men of <i>Manchester</i> did use me well,<br />
Their loves they on the tenter-hooks did rack,<br />
Roast, boiled, baked, too&mdash;too&mdash;much, white, claret,
sack,<br />
Nothing they thought too heavy or too hot,<br />
Can followed can, and pot succeeded pot,<br />
That what they could do, all they thought too little,<br />
Striving in love the traveller to whittle.<br />
We went into the house of one <i>John Pinners</i>,<br />
(A man that lives amongst a crew of sinners)<br />
And there eight several sorts of ale we had,<br />
All able to make one stark drunk or mad.<br />
But I with courage bravely flinched not,<br />
And gave the town leave to discharge the shot.<br />
We had at one time set upon the table,<br />
Good ale of hyssop, 'twas no &AElig;sop-fable:<br />
Then had we ale of sage, and ale of malt,<br />
And ale of wormwood, that could make one halt,<br />
With ale of rosemary, and betony,<br />
And two ales more, or else I needs must lie.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg
18]</a></span>But to conclude this drinking aley-tale,<br />
We had a sort of ale, called scurvy ale.<br />
Thus all these men, at their own charge and cost,<br />
Did strive whose love should be expressed most,<br />
And farther to declare their boundless loves,<br />
They saw I wanted, and they gave me gloves,<br />
In deed, and very deed, their loves were such,<br />
That in their praise I cannot write too much;<br />
They merit more than I have here compiled,<br />
I lodged at the Eagle and the Child,<br />
Whereas my hostess, (a good ancient woman)<br />
Did entertain me with respect, not common.<br />
She caused my linen, shirts, and bands be washed,<br />
And on my way she caused me be refreshed,<br />
She gave me twelve silk points, she gave me bacon,<br />
Which by me much refused, at last was taken,<br />
In troth she proved a mother unto me,<br />
For which, I evermore will thankful be.<br />
But when to mind these kindnesses I call,<br />
Kind Master <i>Prestwitch</i> author is of all,<br />
And yet Sir <i>Urian Leigh's</i> good commendation,<br />
Was the main ground of this my recreation.<br />
From both of them, there what I had, I had,<br />
Or else my entertainment had been bad.<br />
O all you worthy men of <i>Manchester</i>,<br />
(True bred bloods of the County <i>Lancaster</i>)<br />
When I forget what you to me have done,<br />
Then let me headlong to confusion run.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg
19]</a></span>To noble Master <i>Prestwitch</i> I must give<br />
Thanks, upon thanks, as long as I do live,<br />
His love was such, I ne'er can pay the score,<br />
He far surpassed all that went before,<br />
A horse and man he sent, with boundless bounty,<br />
To bring me quite through <i>Lancaster's</i> large county,<br />
Which I well know is fifty miles at large,<br />
And he defrayed all the cost and charge.<br />
This unlooked pleasure, was to me such pleasure,<br />
That I can ne'er express my thanks with measure.<br />
So Mistress <i>Saracoal</i>, hostess kind,<br />
And <i>Manchester</i> with thanks I left behind.<br />
The Wednesday being <i>July's</i> twenty nine,<br />
My journey I to <i>Preston</i> did confine,<br />
All the day long it rained but one shower,<br />
Which from the morning to the evening did pour,<br />
And I, before to <i>Preston</i> I could get,<br />
Was soused, and pickled both with rain and sweat,<br />
But there I was supplied with fire and food,<br />
And anything I wanted sweet and good.<br />
There, at the Hind, kind Master <i>Hind</i> mine host,<br />
Kept a good table, baked and boiled, and roast,<br />
There Wednesday, Thursday, Friday I did stay,<br />
And hardly got from thence on Saturday.<br />
Unto my lodging often did repair,<br />
Kind Master <i>Thomas Banister</i>, the Mayor,<br />
Who is of worship, and of good respect,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
20]</a></span>And in his charge discreet and circumspect.<br />
For I protest to God I never saw,<br />
A town more wisely governed by the law.<br />
They told me when my Sovereign there was last,<br />
That one man's rashness seemed to give distaste.<br />
It grieved them all, but when at last they found,<br />
His Majesty was pleased, their joys were crowned.<br />
He knew, the fairest garden hath some weeds,<br />
He did accept their kind intents, for deeds:<br />
One man there was, that with his zeal too hot,<br />
And furious haste, himself much overshot.<br />
But what man is so foolish, that desires<br />
To get good fruit from thistles, thorns and briars?<br />
Thus much I thought good to demonstrate here,<br />
Because I saw how much they grieved were;<br />
That any way, the least part of offence,<br />
Should make them seem offensive to their Prince.<br />
Thus three nights was I staid and lodged in <i>Preston</i>,<br />
And saw nothing ridiculous to jest on,<br />
Much cost and charge the Mayor upon me spent,<br />
And on my way two miles, with me he went,<br />
There (by good chance) I did more friendship get,<br />
The under Sheriff of <i>Lancashire</i> we met,<br />
A gentleman that loved, and knew me well,<br />
And one whose bounteous mind doth bear the bell.<br />
There, as if I had been a noted thief,<br />
The Mayor delivered me unto the Sheriff.<br />
The Sheriff's authority did much prevail,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg
21]</a></span>He sent me unto one that kept the jail.<br />
Thus I perambuling, poor <i>John Taylor</i>,<br />
Was given from Mayor to Sheriff, from Sheriff to Jailor.<br />
The Jailor kept an inn, good beds, good cheer,<br />
Where paying nothing, I found nothing dear,<br />
For the under-Sheriff kind Master <i>Covill</i> named,<br />
(A man for house-keeping renowed and famed)<br />
Did cause the town of <i>Lancashire</i> afford<br />
Me welcome, as if I had been a lord.<br />
And 'tis reported, that for daily bounty,<br />
His mate can scarce be found in all that county.<br />
The extremes of miser, or of prodigal,<br />
He shuns, and lives discreet and liberal,<br />
His wife's mind, and his own are one, so fixed,<br />
That <i>Argus</i> eyes could see no odds betwixt,<br />
And sure the difference, (if there difference be)<br />
Is who shall do most good, or he, or she.<br />
Poor folks report, that for relieving them,<br />
He and his wife, are each of them a gem;<br />
At the inn, and at his house two nights I staid,<br />
And what was to be paid, I know he paid:<br />
If nothing of their kindness I had wrote,<br />
Ungrateful me the world might justly note:<br />
Had I declared all I did hear, and see,<br />
For a great flatterer then I deemed should be,<br />
Him and his wife, and modest daughter <i>Bess</i>,<br />
With earth, and heaven's felicity, God bless.<br />
Two days a man of his, at his command,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg
22]</a></span>Did guide me to the midst of
<i>Westmoreland</i>,<br />
And my conductor with a liberal fist,<br />
To keep me moist, scarce any alehouse missed.<br />
The fourth of August (weary, halt, and lame)<br />
We in the dark, to a town called <i>Sedbergh</i> came,<br />
There Master <i>Borrowed</i>, my kind honest host,<br />
Upon me did bestowed unasked cost.<br />
The next day I held on my journey still,<br />
Six miles unto a place called <i>Carling</i> hill,<br />
Where Master <i>Edmund Branthwaite</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10"
id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a> doth reside,<br />
Who made me welcome, with my man and guide.<br />
Our entertainment, and our fare were such,<br />
It might have satisfied our betters much;<br />
Yet all too little was, his kind heart thought,<br />
And five miles on my way himself me brought,<br />
At <i>Orton</i> he, I, and my man did dine,<br />
With Master <i>Corney</i> a good true Divine,<br />
And surely Master <i>Branthwaite</i>'s well beloved,<br />
His firm integrity is much approved:<br />
His good effects, do make him still affected<br />
Of God and good men, (with regard) respected.<br />
He sent his man with me, o'er dale and down,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg
23]</a></span>Who lodged, and boarded me at <i>Penrith</i>
town,<br />
And such good cheer, and bedding there I had,<br />
That nothing, (but my weary self) was bad;<br />
There a fresh man, (I know not for whose sake)<br />
With me a journey would to <i>Carlisle</i> make:<br />
But from that city, about two miles wide,<br />
Good Sir <i>John Dalston</i> lodged me and my guide.<br />
Of all the gentlemen in <i>England's</i> bounds<br />
His house is nearest to the Scottish grounds,<br />
And fame proclaims him, far and near, aloud,<br />
He's free from being covetous, or proud;<br />
His son, Sir <i>George</i>, most affable, and kind,<br />
His father's image, both in form and mind,<br />
On Saturday to <i>Carlisle</i> both did ride,<br />
Where (by their loves and leaves) I did abide,<br />
Where of good entertainment I found store,<br />
From one that was the mayor the year before,<br />
His name is Master <i>Adam Robinson</i>,<br />
I the last English friendship with him won.<br />
He (<i>gratis</i>) found a guide to bring me through,<br />
<span class="sidenote"><i>My thanks to Sir John and Sir Geo.
Dalston, with Sir Henry Curwin.</i></span>
From <i>Carlisle</i> to the city
<i>Edinburgh</i>:<br />
This was a help, that was a help alone,<br />
Of all my helps inferior unto none.<br />
Eight miles from <i>Carlisle</i> runs a little river,<br />
Which <i>England's</i> bounds, from <i>Scotland's</i> grounds
doth sever.<br />
Without horse, bridge, or boat, I o'er did get<br />
<span class="sidenote"><i>Over Esk I waded.</i></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>On foot, I went, yet
scarce my shoes did wet.<br />
I being come to this long-looked-for land,<br />
Did mark, remark, note, renote, viewed, and scanned;<br />
And I saw nothing that could change my will,<br />
But that I thought myself in <i>England</i> still.<br />
The kingdoms are so nearly joined and fixed,<br />
There scarcely went a pair of shears betwixt;<br />
There I saw sky above, and earth below,<br />
And as in <i>England</i>, there the sun did show;<br />
The hills with sheep replete, with corn the dale,<br />
<span class="sidenote"><i>The afore-named knights had given money
to my guide, of which he left some part at every
ale-house.</i></span>
And many a cottage yielded good
Scottish ale;<br />
This county (<i>Avondale</i>) in former times,<br />
Was the cursed climate of rebellious crimes:<br />
For <i>Cumberland</i> and it, both kingdoms borders,<br />
Were ever ordered, by their own disorders,<br />
Some sharking, shifting, cutting throats, and thieving,<br />
Each taking pleasure in the other's grieving;<br />
And many times he that had wealth to-night,<br />
Was by the morrow morning beggared quite:<br />
Too many years this pell-mell fury lasted,<br />
That all these borders were quite spoiled and wasted,<br />
Confusion, hurly-burly reigned and revelled,<br />
The churches with the lowly ground were levelled;<br />
All memorable monuments defaced,<br />
All places of defence o'erthrown and razed.<br />
That whoso then did in the borders dwell,<br />
Lived little happier than those in hell.<br />
But since the all-disposing God of heaven,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg
25]</a></span>Hath these two kingdoms to one monarch given,<br />
Blest peace, and plenty on them both have showered,<br />
Exile, and hanging hath the thieves devoured,<br />
That now each subject may securely sleep,<br />
His sheep and neat, the black the white doth keep,<br />
For now those crowns are both in one combined,<br />
Those former borders, that each one confine,<br />
Appears to me (as I do understand)<br />
To be almost the centre of the land,<br />
This was a blessed heaven expounded riddle,<br />
To thrust great kingdoms skirts into the middle.<br />
Long may the instrumental cause survive.<br />
From him and his, succession still derive<br />
True heirs unto his virtues, and his throne,<br />
That these two kingdoms ever may be one;<br />
This county of all <i>Scotland</i> is most poor,<br />
By reason of the outrages before,<br />
Yet mighty store of corn I saw there grow,<br />
And as good grass as ever man did mow:<br />
And as that day I twenty miles did pass,<br />
I saw eleven hundred neat at grass,<br />
By which may be conjectured at the least,<br />
That there was sustenance for man and beast.<br />
And in the kingdom I have truly scanned,<br />
There's many worser parts, are better manned,<br />
For in the time that thieving was in ure,<br />
The gentles fled to places more secure.<br />
And left the poorer sort, to abide the pain,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg
26]</a></span>Whilst they could ne'er find time to turn
again.<br />
The shire of gentlemen is scarce and dainty,<br />
Yet there's relief in great abundance plenty,<br />
Twixt it and England, little odds I see,<br />
They eat, and live, and strong and able be,<br />
So much in verse, and now I'll change my style,<br />
And seriously I'll write in prose awhile.<br /></p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">To the purpose then: my first
night's lodging in <i>Scotland</i> was at a place called
<i>Moffat</i>, which they say, is thirty miles from
<i>Carlisle</i>, but I suppose them to be longer than forty of
such miles as are betwixt <i>London</i> and Saint <i>Albans</i>,
(but indeed the Scots do allow almost as large measure of their
miles, as they do of their drink, for an English gallon either of
ale or wine, is but their quart, and one Scottish mile (now and
then, may well stand for a mile and a half or two English) but
howsoever short or long, I found that day's journey the weariest
that ever I footed; and at night, being come to the town, I found
good ordinary country entertainment: my fare and my lodging was
sweet and good, and might have served a far better man than
myself, although myself have had many times better: but this is
to be noted, that though it rained not all the day, yet it was my
fortune to be well wet twice, for I waded over a great river
called <i>Esk</i> in the morning, somewhat more than four miles
distance from <i>Carlisle</i> in <i>England</i>, and at night
within two miles of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id=
"Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> lodging, I was fain to wade over the
river of <i>Annan</i> in <i>Scotland</i>, from which river the
county of <i>Annandale</i>, hath its name. And whilst I waded on
foot, my man was mounted on horseback, like the <i>George</i>
without the Dragon. But the next morning, I arose and left
<i>Moffat</i> behind me, and that day I travelled twenty-one
miles to a sorry village called <i>Blythe</i>, but I was blithe
myself to come to any place of harbour or succour, for since I
was born, I never was so weary, or so near being dead with
extreme travel: I was foundered and refoundered of all four, and
for my better comfort, I came so late, that I must lodge without
doors all night, or else in a poor house where the good wife lay
in child-bed, her husband being from home, her own servant maid
being her nurse. A creature naturally compacted, and artificially
adorned with an incomparable homeliness: but as things were I
must either take or leave, and necessity made me enter, where we
got eggs and ale by measure and by tail. At last to bed I went,
my man lying on the floor by me, where in the night there were
pigeons did very bountifully mute in his face: the day being no
sooner come, and having but fifteen miles to <i>Edinburgh</i>,
mounted upon my ten toes, and began first to hobble, and after to
amble, and so being warm, I fell to pace by degrees; all the way
passing through a fertile country for corn and cattle: and about
two of the clock in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28"
id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> afternoon that Wednesday, being
the thirteenth of August, and the day of <i>Clare</i> the Virgin
(the sign being in <i>Virgo</i>) the moon four days old, the wind
at west, I came to take rest, at the wished, long expected,
ancient famous city of <i>Edinburgh</i>, which I entered like
Pierce Penniless,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id=
"FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a> altogether moneyless, but I thank God, not
friendless; for being there, for the time of my stay, I might
borrow, (if any man would lend) spend if I could get, beg if I
had the impudence, and steal, if I durst adventure the price of a
hanging, but my purpose was to house my horse, and to suffer him
and my apparel to lie in durance, or lavender instead of litter,
till such time as I could meet with some valiant friend, that
would desperately disburse.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Walking thus down the street, (my
body being tired with travel, and my mind attired with moody,
muddy, Moor-ditch melancholy) my contemplation did devotely pray,
that I might meet one or other to prey upon, being willing to
take any slender acquaintance of any map whatsoever, viewing, and
circumviewing every man's face I met, as if I meant to draw his
picture, but all my acquaintance was <i>Non est inventus</i>,
(pardon me, reader, that Latin is none of my own, I swear by
<i>Priscian's Pericranium</i>, an oath which I have ignorantly
broken many times.) <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id=
"Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>At last I resolved, that the next
gentleman that I meet withal, should be acquaintance whether he
would or no: and presently fixing mine eyes upon a gentleman-like
object, I looked on him, as if I would survey something through
him, and make him my perspective: and he much musing at my
gazing, and I much gazing at his musing, at last he crossed the
way and made toward me, and then I made down the street from him,
leaving to encounter with any man, who came after me leading my
horse, whom he thus accosted. My friend (quoth he) doth yonder
gentleman, (meaning me) know me, that he looks so wistly on me?
Truly sir, said my man, I think not, but my master is a stranger
come from <i>London</i>, and would gladly meet some acquaintance
to direct him where he may have lodging and horse-meat. Presently
the gentleman, (being of a generous disposition) overtook me with
unexpected and undeserved courtesy, brought me to a lodging, and
caused my horse to be put into his own stable, whilst we
discoursing over a pint of Spanish, I relate as much English to
him, as made him lend me ten shillings, (his name was Master
<i>John Maxwell</i>) which money I am sure was the first that I
handled after I came from out the walls of <i>London</i>: but
having rested two hours and refreshed myself, the gentleman and I
walked to see the City and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> the Castle, which as my poor
unable and unworthy pen can, I will truly describe.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">The Castle on a lofty rock is so
strongly grounded, bounded, and founded, that by force of man it
can never be confounded; the foundation and walls are
unpenetrable, the rampiers impregnable, the bulwarks invincible,
no way but one it is or can be possible to be made passable. In a
word, I have seen many straits and fortresses, in <i>Germany</i>,
the <i>Netherlands</i>, <i>Spain</i> and <i>England</i>, but they
must all give place to this unconquered Castle, both for strength
and situation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Amongst the many memorable things
which I was shewed there, I noted especially a great piece of
ordnance of iron, it is not for battery, but it will serve to
defend a breach, or to toss balls of wild-fire against any that
should assail or assault the Castle; it lies now
dismounted.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id=
"FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class=
"fnanchor">[12]</a> And it is so great within, that it was told
me that a child was once gotten there: but I, to make trial crept
into it, lying on my back, and I am sure there was room enough
and spare for a greater than myself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">So leaving the Castle, as it is
both defensive against my opposition, and magnific for lodging
and receite,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id=
"FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a> I descended lower to the City, wherein I
observed the fairest and goodliest street that ever <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>mine
eyes beheld, for I did never see or hear of a street of that
length, (which is half an English mile from the Castle to a fair
port which they call the <i>Nether-Bow</i>) and from that port,
the street which they call the <i>Kenny-gate</i> is one quarter
of a mile more, down to the King's Palace, called
<i>Holy-rood-House</i>, the buildings on each side of the way
being all of squared stone, five, six, and seven stories high,
and many bye-lanes and closes on each side of the way, wherein
are gentlemen's houses, much fairer than the buildings in the
High Street, for in the High Street the merchants and tradesmen
do dwell, but the gentlemen's mansions and goodliest houses are
obscurely founded in the aforesaid lanes: the walls are eight or
ten foot thick, exceeding strong, not built for a day, a week, or
a month, or a year; but from antiquity to posterity, for many
ages; there I found entertainment beyond my expectation or merit,
and there is fish, flesh, bread and fruit, in such variety, that
I think I may offenceless call it superfluity, or satiety. The
worst was, that wine and ale was so scarce, and the people there
such misers of it, that every night before I went to bed, if any
man had asked me a civil question, all the wit in my head could
not have made him a sober answer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">I was at his Majesty's Palace, a
stately and princely seat, wherein I saw a sumptuous chapel, most
richly adorned with all appurtenances belong<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ing to
so sacred a place, or so royal an owner. In the inner court I saw
the King's arms cunningly carved in stone, and fixed over a door
aloft on the wall, the red lion being in the crest, over which
was written this inscription in Latin,</p>
<h4><i>Nobis h&aelig;c invicta miserunt, 106 proavi.</i></h4>
<p>I enquired what the English of it was? it was told me as
followeth, which I thought worthy to be recorded.</p>
<h4><i>106, forefathers have left this to us
unconquered.</i></h4>
<p>This is a worthy and memorable motto, and I think few kingdoms
or none in the world can truly write the like, that
notwithstanding so many inroads, incursions, attempts, assaults,
civil wars, and foreign hostilities, bloody battles, and mighty
foughten fields, that maugre the strength and policy of enemies,
that royal crown and sceptre hath from one hundred and seven
descents, kept still unconquered, and by the power of the King of
Kings (through the grace of the Prince of Peace) is now left
peacefully to our peaceful king, whom long in blessed peace, the
God of peace defend and govern.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">But once more, a word or two of
<i>Edinburgh</i>, although I have scarcely given it that due
which belongs unto it, for their lofty and stately buildings, and
for their fair and spacious street, yet my mind persuades me that
they in former ages that first founded that city did not so well
in that they built it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id=
"Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> in so discommodious a place; for the
sea, and all navigable rivers being the chief means for the
enriching of towns and cities, by the reason of traffic with
foreign nations, with exportation, transportation, and receite of
variety of merchandizing; so this city had it been built but one
mile lower on the seaside, I doubt not but it had long before
this been comparable to many a one of our greatest towns and
cities in <i>Europe</i>, both for spaciousness of bounds, port,
state, and riches. It is said, that King <i>James</i> the fifth
(of famous memory) did graciously offer to purchase for them, and
to bestow upon them freely, certain low and pleasant grounds a
mile from them on the seashore, with these conditions, that they
should pull down their city, and build it in that more commodious
place, but the citizens refused it; and so now it is like (for
me), to stand where it doth, for I doubt such another proffer of
removal will not be presented to them, till two days after the
fair.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Now have with you for
<i>Leith</i>, whereto I no sooner came, but I was well
entertained by Master <i>Barnard Lindsay</i>, one of the grooms
of his Majesties bed-chamber, he knew my estate was not guilty,
because I brought guilt with me (more than my sins, and they
would not pass for current there) he therefore did replenish the
vaustity<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of my empty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg
34]</a></span>purse, and discharged a piece at me with two
bullets of gold, each being in value worth eleven shillings white
money; and I was creditably informed, that within the compass of
one year, there was shipped away from that only port of
<i>Leith</i>, fourscore thousand boles of wheat, oats, and barley
into <i>Spain</i>, <i>France</i>, and other foreign parts, and
every bole contains the measure of four English bushels, so that
from <i>Leith</i> only hath been transported three hundred and
twenty thousand bushels of corn; besides some hath been shipped
away from Saint <i>Andrews</i>, from <i>Dundee</i>,
<i>Aberdeen</i>, <i>Dysart</i>, <i>Kirkaldy</i>, <i>Kinghorn</i>,
<i>Burntisland</i>, <i>Dunbar</i>, and other portable towns,
which makes me to wonder that a kingdom so populous as it is,
should nevertheless sell so much bread-corn beyond the seas, and
yet to have more than sufficient for themselves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">So I having viewed the haven and
town of <i>Leith</i>, took a passage boat to see the new wondrous
Well,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> to which many a one
that is not well, comes far and near in hope to be made well:
indeed I did hear that it had done much good, and that it hath a
rare operation to expel or kill divers maladies; as to provoke
appetite, to help much for the avoiding of the gravel in the
bladder, to cure sore eyes, and old ulcers, with many other
virtues which it hath, but I (through the mercy of God, having
no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg
35]</a></span> need of it, did make no great inquisition what it
had done, but for novelty I drank of it, and I found the taste to
be more pleasant than any other water, sweet almost as milk, yet
as clear as crystal, and I did observe that though a man did
drink a quart, a pottle, or as much as his belly could contain,
yet it never offended or lay heavy upon the stomach, no more than
if one had drank but a pint or a small quantity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">I went two miles from it to a town
called <i>Burntisland</i>, where I found many of my especial good
friends, as Master <i>Robert Hay</i>, one of the Grooms of his
Majesty's Bed-chamber, Master <i>David Drummond</i>, one of his
Gentlemens-Pensioners, Master <i>James Acmootye</i>, one of the
Grooms of the Privy Chamber, Captain <i>Murray</i>, Sir <i>Henry
Witherington</i> Knight, Captain <i>Tyrie</i>, and divers others:
and there Master <i>Hay</i>, Master <i>Drummond</i>, and the good
old Captain <i>Murray</i> did very bountifully furnish me with
gold for my expenses, but I being at dinner with those aforesaid
gentlemen, as we were discoursing, there befel a strange
accident, which I think worth the relating.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">I know not upon what occasion they
began to talk of being at sea in former times, and I (amongst the
rest) said, I was at the taking of <i>Cadiz</i>; whereto an
English gentleman replied, that he was the next good voyage after
at the Islands: I answered him<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> that I was there also.
He demanded in what ship I was? I told him in the Rainbow of the
Queens: why (quoth he) do you not know me? I was in the same
ship, and my name is <i>Witherington</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Sir, said I, I do remember the
name well, but by reason that it is near two and twenty years
since I saw you, I may well forget the knowledge of you. Well
said he, if you were in that ship, I pray you tell me some
remarkable token that happened in the voyage, whereupon I told
him two or three tokens; which he did know to be true. Nay then,
said I, I will tell you another which (perhaps) you have not
forgotten; as our ship and the rest of the fleet did ride at
anchor at the Isle of <i>Flores</i> (one of the Isles of the
<i>Azores</i>) there were some fourteen men and boys of our ship,
that for novelty would go ashore, and see what fruit the island
did bear, and what entertainment it would yield us; so being
landed, we went up and down and could find nothing but stones,
heath and moss, and we expected oranges, lemons, figs,
muskmellions, and potatoes; in
the mean space the wind did blow so stiff, and the sea was so
extreme rough, that our ship-boat could not come to the land to
fetch us, for fear she should be beaten in pieces against the
rocks; this continued five days, so that we were almost famished
for want of food: but at last (I squandering up and down) by the
providence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id=
"Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> of God I happened into a cave or
poor habitation, where I found fifteen loaves of bread, each of
the quantity of a penny loaf in <i>England</i>, I having a
valiant stomach of the age of almost of a hundred and twenty
hours breeding, fell to, and ate two loaves and never said grace:
and as I was about to make a horse-loaf of the third loaf, I did
put twelve of them into my breeches, and my sleeves, and so went
mumbling out of the cave, leaning my back against a tree, when
upon the sudden a gentleman came to me, and said, "Friend, what
are you eating?" "Bread," (quoth I,) "For God's sake," said he,
"give me some." With that, I put my hand into my breech, (being
my best pantry) and I gave him a loaf, which he received with
many thanks, and said, that if ever he could requit it, he
would.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">I had no sooner told this tale,
but Sir <i>Henry Witherington</i> did acknowledge himself to be
the man that I had given the loaf unto two and twenty years
before, where I found the proverb true, that men have more
privilege than mountains in meeting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">In what great measure he did
requite so small a courtesy, I will relate in this following
discourse in my return through <i>Northumberland</i>: so leaving
my man at the town of <i>Burntisland</i>, I told him, I would but
go to <i>Stirling</i>, and see the Castle there, and withal to
see my honourable friends the Earl of<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<i>Mar</i>, and Sir <i>William Murray</i> Knight, Lord of
<i>Abercairney</i>, and that I would return within two days at
the most: but it fell out quite contrary; for it was and five and
thirty days before I could get back again out of these noble
men's company. The whole progress of my travel with them, and the
cause of my stay I cannot with gratefulness omit; and thus it
was.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">A worthy gentleman named Master
<i>John Fenton</i>, did bring me on my way six miles to
<i>Dunfermline</i>, where I was well entertained, and lodged at
Master <i>John Gibb</i> his house, one of the Grooms of his
Majesty's Bed-chamber, and I think the oldest servant the King
hath: withal, I was well entertained there by Master
<i>Crighton</i> at his own house, who went with me, and shewed me
the Queens Palace; (a delicate and Princely Mansion) withal I saw
the ruins of an ancient and stately built Abbey, with fair
gardens, orchards, meadows belonging to the Palace: all which
with fair and goodly revenues by the suppression of the Abbey,
were annexed to the crown. There also I saw a very fair church,
which though it be now very large and spacious, yet it hath in
former times been much larger. But I taking my leave of
<i>Dunfermline</i>, would needs go and see the truly noble Knight
Sir <i>George Bruce</i>, at a town called the <i>Culross</i>:
there he made me right welcome, both with variety of fare, and
after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg
39]</a></span> all, he commanded three of his men to direct me to
see his most admirable coal mines; which (if man can or could
work wonders) is a wonder; for myself neither in any travels that
I have been in, nor any history that I have read, or any
discourse that I have heard, did never see, read, or hear of any
work of man that might parallel or be equivalent with this
unfellowed and unmatchable work: and though all I can say of it,
cannot describe it according to the worthiness of his vigilant
industry, that was both the occasion, inventor, and maintainer of
it: yet rather than the memory of so rare an enterprise, and so
accomplished a profit to the commonwealth shall be raked and
smothered in the dust of oblivion, I will give a little touch at
the description of it, although I amongst writers, am like he
that worse may hold the candle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">The mine hath two ways into it,
the one by sea and the other by land; but a man may go into it by
land, and return the same way if he please, and so he may enter
into it by sea, and by sea he may come forth of it: but I for
variety's sake went in by sea, and out by land. Now men may
object, how can a man go into a mine, the entrance of it being
into the sea, but that the sea will follow him, and so drown the
mine? To which objection thus I answer, that at low water mark,
the sea being ebbed away, and a great part of the sand bare; upon
this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg
40]</a></span></p>
same sand (being mixed with rocks and crags) did the master of
this great work build a round circular frame of stone, very
thick, strong, and joined together with glutinous or bituminous
matter, so high withal that the sea at the highest flood, or the
greatest rage of storm or tempest, can neither dissolve the
stones so well compacted in the building or yet overflow the
height of it. Within this round frame, (at all adventures) he did
set workmen to dig with mattocks, pickaxes, and other instruments
fit for such purposes. They did dig forty feet down right into
and through a rock. At last they found that which they expected,
which was sea coal, they following the vein of the mine, did dig
forward still: so that in the space of eight and twenty, or nine
and twenty years, they have digged more
than an English mile under the sea, so that when men are at work
below, an hundred of the greatest ships in <i>Britain</i> man
sail over their heads. Besides, the mine is most artificially cut
like an arch or a vault, all that great length, with many nooks
and bye-ways: and it is so made, that a man may walk upright in
the most places, both in and out. Many poor people are there set
on work, which otherwise through the want of employment would
perish. But when I had seen the mine, and was come forth of it
again; after my thanks given to Sir <i>George Bruce</i>, I told
him, that if the plotters of the
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg
41]</a></span></p>
Powder Treason in England had seen this mine, that they (perhaps)
would have attempted to have left the Parliament House, and have
undermined the Thames, and so to have blown up the barges and
wherries, wherein the King, and all the estates of our kingdom
were. Moreover, I said, that I couldafford to turn tapster at
<i>London</i>, so that I had but<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">one quarter of a mile of his mine
to make me</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">a cellar, to keep beer and
bottled ale</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">in. But leaving these jests
in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">prose, I will relate a
few</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">verses that I
made</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">merrily of this</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">mine.</span><br />

And took my leave of good Sir <i>George</i> at last.<br /></p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">The sea at certain places doth
leak, or soak into the mine, which by the industry of Sir
<i>George Bruce</i>, is all conveyed to one well near the land;
where he hath a device like a horse-mill, that with three horses
and a great chain of iron, going downward many fathoms, with
thirty-six buckets fastened <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>to the chain, of the
which eighteen go down still to be filled, and eighteen ascend up
to be emptied, which do empty themselves (without any man's
labour) into a trough that conveys the water into the sea again;
by which means he saves his mine, which otherwise would be
destroyed with the sea, besides he doth make every week ninety or
a hundred tons of salt, which doth serve most part of
<i>Scotland</i>, some he sends into <i>England</i>, and very much
into <i>Germany</i>: all which shows the painful industry with
God's blessings to such worthy endeavours: I must with many
thanks remember his courtesy to me, and lastly how he sent his
man to guide me ten miles on the way to <i>Stirling</i>, where by
the way I saw the outside of a fair and stately house called
<i>Allaway</i>, belonging to the Earl of <i>Mar</i> which by
reason that his honour was not there, I past by and went to
<i>Stirling</i>, where I was entertained and lodged at one Master
John <i>Archibalds</i>, where all my want was that I wanted room
to contain half the good cheer that I might have had there! he
had me into the castle, which in few words I do compare to
<i>Windsor</i> for situation, much more than <i>Windsor</i> in
strength, and somewhat less in greatness: yet I dare affirm that
his Majesty hath not such another hall to any house that he hath
neither in <i>England</i> or <i>Scotland</i>, except Westminster
Hall which is now no dwelling hall<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> for a prince, being
long since metamorphosed into a house for the law and the
profits.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">This goodly hall was built by King
<i>James</i> the fourth, that married King <i>Henry</i> the
Eight's sister, and after was slain at <i>Flodden field</i>; but
it surpasses all the halls for dwelling houses that ever I saw,
for length, breadth, height and strength of building, the castle
is built upon a rock very lofty, and much beyond <i>Edinburgh</i>
Castle in state and magnificence, and not much inferior to it in
strength, the rooms of it are lofty, with carved works on the
ceilings, the doors of each room being so high, that a man may
ride upright on horseback into any chamber or lodging. There is
also a goodly fair chapel, with cellars, stables, and all other
necessary offices, all very stately and befitting the majesty of
a king.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">From <i>Stirling</i> I rode to
Saint <i>Johnstone</i>,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id=
"FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class=
"fnanchor">[19]</a> a fine town it is, but it is much decayed, by
reason of the want of his Majesty's yearly coming to lodge there.
There I lodged one night at an inn, the goodman of the house his
name being <i>Patrick Pitcairne</i>, where my entertainment was
with good cheer, good lodging, all too good to a bad weary guest.
Mine host told me that the Earl of <i>Mar</i>, and Sir <i>William
Murray</i> of <i>Abercairney</i> were gone to the great hunting
to the <i>Brae</i> of <i>Mar</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id=
"FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class=
"fnanchor">[20]</a>; but if<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> I made haste I might
perhaps find them at a town called <i>Brekin</i>, or
<i>Brechin</i>, two and thirty miles from Saint <i>Johnstone</i>
whereupon I took a guide to <i>Brechin</i> the next day, but
before I came, my lord was gone from thence four days.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Then I took another guide, which
brought me such strange ways over mountains and rocks, that I
think my horse never went the like; and I am sure I never saw any
ways that might fellow them I did go through a country called
<i>Glen Esk</i>, where passing by the side of a hill, so steep as
the ridge of a house, where the way was rocky, and not above a
yard broad in some places, so fearful and horrid it was to look
down into the bottom, for if either horse or man had slipped, he
had fallen without recovery a good mile
downright; but I thank God, at night I came to a lodging in the
Laird of <i>Edzell's</i> land, where I lay at an Irish house, the
folks not being able to speak scarce any English, but I supped
and went to bed, where I had not laid long, but I was enforced to
rise, I was so stung with Irish mosquitoes, a creature that hath
six legs, and lives like a monster altogether upon man's flesh,
they do inhabit and breed most in sluttish houses, and this house
was none of the cleanest, the beast is much like a louse in
<i>England</i>, both in shape and nature; in a word, they were to
me the <i>A.</i> and the <i>Z.</i> the prologue and the epilogue,
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg
47]</a></span> first and the last that I had in all my travels
from <i>Edinburgh</i>; and had not this Highland Irish house
helped me at a pinch, I should have sworn that all
<i>Scotland</i> had not been so kind as to have bestowed a louse
upon me: but with a shift that I had, I shifted off my cannibals,
and was never more troubled with them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">The next day I travelled over an
exceeding high mountain, called mount <i>Skene</i>, where I found
the valley very warm before I went up it; but when I came to the
top of it, my teeth began to dance in my head with cold, like
Virginal's jacks;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id=
"FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a> and withal, a most familiar mist embraced me
round, that I could not see thrice my length any way: withal, it
yielded so friendly a dew, that did moisten through all my
clothes: where the old Proverb of a Scottish mist was verified,
in wetting me to the skin. Up and down, I think this hill is six
miles, the way so uneven, stony, and full of bogs, quagmires, and
long heath, that a dog with three legs will out-run a horse with
four; for do what we could, we were four hours before we could
pass it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Thus with extreme travel,
ascending and descending, mounting and alighting, I came at night
to the place where I would be, in the Brae of <i>Mar</i>, which
is a large county, all composed of such mountains, that Shooter's
Hill, Gad's Hill, Highgate <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Hill, Hampstead Hill,
Birdlip Hill, or Malvern's Hills, are but mole-hills in
comparison, or like a liver, or a gizard
under a capon's wing, in respect of the altitude of their tops,
or perpendicularity of their bottoms. There I saw Mount <i>Ben
Aven</i>, with a furred mist upon his snowy head instead of a
night-cap: (for you must understand, that the oldest man alive
never saw but the snow was on the top of divers of those hills,
both in summer, as well as in winter.) There did I find the truly
Noble and Right Honourable Lords <i>John Erskine</i> Earl of Mar,
<i>James Stuart</i> Earl of Murray, <i>George Gordon</i> Earl of
Enzie, son and heir to the Marquess of Huntly, <i>James
Erskine</i> Earl of Buchan, and <i>John</i> Lord <i>Erskine</i>,
son and heir to the Earl of Mar, and their Countesses, with my
much honoured, and my best assured and approved friend, Sir
<i>William Murray</i> Knight, of <i>Abercairney</i>, and hundred
of others Knights, Esquires, and their followers; all and every
man in general in one habit, as if <i>Lycurgus</i> had been
there, and made laws of equality: for once in the year, which is
the whole month of August, and sometimes part of September, many
of the nobility and gentry of the kingdom (for their pleasure) do
come into these Highland Countries to hunt, where they do conform
themselves to the habit of the Highland men, who for the most
part speak nothing but Irish;<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> and in former time were
those people which were called the <i>Red-shanks</i>.<a name=
"FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Their habit is shoes
with but one sole apiece; stockings (which they call short hose)
made of a warm stuff of divers colours, which they call tartan:
as for breeches, many of them, nor their forefathers never wore
any, but a jerkin of the same stuff that their hose is of, their
garters being bands or wreaths of hay or straw, with a plaid
about their shoulders, which is a mantle of divers colours, of
much finer and lighter stuff than their hose, with blue flat caps
on their heads, a handkerchief knit with two knots about their
neck; and thus are they attired. Now their weapons are long bows
and forked arrows, swords and targets, harquebusses, muskets,
dirks, and Lochaber axes. With these arms I found many of them
armed for the hunting. As for their attire, any man of what
degree soever that comes amongst them, must not disdain to wear
it; for if they do, then they will disdain to hunt, or willingly,
to bring in their dogs: but if men be kind unto them, and be in
their habit; then are they conquered with kindness, and the sport
will be plentiful. This was the reason that I found so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg
50]</a></span>many noblemen and gentlemen in those shapes. But to
proceed to the hunting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">My good Lord of <i>Mar</i> having
put me into that shape,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id=
"FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class=
"fnanchor">[23]</a> I rode with him from his house, where I saw
the ruins of an old castle, called the castle of
<i>Kindroghit</i> [Castletown]. It was built by King <i>Malcolm
Canmore</i> (for a hunting house) who reigned in <i>Scotland</i>
when <i>Edward</i> the Confessor, <i>Harold</i>, and Norman
<i>William</i> reigned in <i>England</i>: I speak of it, because
it was the last house that I saw in those parts; for I was the
space of twelve days after, before I saw either house, corn
field, or habitation for any creature, but deer, wild horses,
wolves, and such like creatures, which made me doubt that I
should never have seen a house again.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id=
"FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class=
"fnanchor">[24]</a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Thus the first day we travelled
eight miles, where there small cottages built on purpose to lodge
in, which they call Lonchards, I thank my good Lord
<i>Erskine</i>, he commanded that I should always be lodged in
his lodging, the kitchen being always on the side of a bank, many
kettles and pots boiling, and many spits turning and winding,
with great variety of cheer: as venison baked, sodden, roast, and
stewed beef, mutton, goats, kid, hares, fresh salmon, pigeons,
hens, capons, chickens, partridge, moor-coots, heath-cocks,
capercailzies, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id=
"Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>termagants [ptarmigans]; good ale,
sack, white, and claret, tent, (or Alicante) with most potent
<i>Aquavit&aelig;</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">All these, and more than these we
had continually, in superfluous abundance, caught by Falconers,
Fowlers, Fishers, and brought by my Lord's tenants and purveyors
to victual our camp, which consisted of fourteen or fifteen
hundred men and horses; the manner of the hunting is this: five
or six hundred men do rise early in the morning, and they do
disperse themselves divers ways, and seven, eight, or ten miles
compass, they do bring or chase in the deer in many herds, (two,
three, or four hundred in a herd) to such or such a place, as the
Nobleman shall appoint them; then when day is come, the Lords and
gentlemen of their companies, do ride or go to the said places,
sometimes wading up to their middles through bournes and rivers:
and then: they being come to the place, do lie down on the
ground, till those foresaid scouts which are called the Tinchel,
do bring down the deer: but as the proverb says of a bad cook, so
these Tinchel-men do lick their own fingers; for besides their
bows and arrows, which they carry with them, we can hear now and
then a harquebuss or a musket go off, which they do seldom
discharge in vain: Then after we had stayed there three hours or
thereabouts, we might perceive the deer appear on the hills round
about us, (their heads making a show like<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> a
wood) which being followed close by the Tinchel, are chased down
into the valley where we lay; then all the valley on each side
being waylaid with a hundred couple of strong Irish greyhounds,
they are let loose as the occasion serves upon the herd of deer,
so that with dogs, guns, arrows, dirks, and daggers, in the space
of two hours, fourscore fat deer were slain, which after are
disposed of some one way, and some another, twenty and thirty
miles, and more than enough left for us to make merry withal at
our rendezvous. I liked the sport so well, that I made these two
sonnets following.</p>

f sport like this can on the

<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Being come to our lodgings, there
was such baking, boiling, roasting, and stewing, as if Cook
Ruffian had been there to have scalded the devil in his feathers:
and after supper a fire of fir-wood as high as an indifferent
May-pole: for I assure you, that the Earl of <i>Mar</i> will give
any man that is his friend, for thanks, as many fir trees (that
are as good as any ship's masts in England) as are worth if they
were in any place near the Thames, or<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> any
other portable river) the best earldom in England or Scotland
either: For I dare affirm, he hath as many growing there, as
would serve for masts (from this time to the end of the world)
for all the ships, caracks, hoys, galleys, boats, drumlers,
barks, and water-crafts, that are now, or can be in the world
these forty years.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">This sounds like a lie to an
unbeliever; but I and many thousands do know that I speak within
the compass of truth: for indeed (the more is the pity) they do
grow so far from any passage of water, and withal in such rocky
mountains, that no way to convey them is possible to be passable,
either with boat, horse, or cart.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Thus having spent certain days in
hunting in the Brae of <i>Mar</i>, we went to the next county
called <i>Badenoch</i>, belonging to the Earl of <i>Enzie</i>,
where having such sport and entertainment as we formerly had;
after four or five days pastime, we took leave of hunting for
that year; and took our journey toward a strong house of the
Earl's, called <i>Ruthven</i> in <i>Badenoch</i>, where my Lord
of <i>Enzie</i> and his noble Countess (being daughter to the
Earl of <i>Argyle</i>) did give us most noble welcome three
days.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">From thence we went to a place
called <i>Balloch Castle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id=
"FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class=
"fnanchor">[25]</a> a fair and stately house, a worthy gentleman
being the owner of it, called the Laird of <i>Grant</i>;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg
55]</a></span>his wife being a gentlewoman honourably descended
being sister to the right Honourable Earl of <i>Athol</i>, and to
Sir <i>Patrick Murray</i> Knight; she being both inwardly and
outwardly plentifully adorned with the gifts of grace and nature:
so that our cheer was more than sufficient; and yet much less
than they could afford us. There stayed there four days, four
Earls, one Lord, divers Knights and Gentlemen, and their
servants, footmen and horses; and every meal four long tables
furnished with all varieties: our first and second course being
three score dishes at one board; and after that always a banquet:
and there if I had not forsworn wine till I came to
<i>Edinburgh</i> I think I had there drunk my last.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">The fifth day with much ado we
gate from thence to <i>Tarnaway</i>, a goodly house of the Earl
of <i>Murrays</i>,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id=
"FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class=
"fnanchor">[26]</a> where that Right Honourable Lord and his Lady
did welcome us four days more. There was good cheer in all
variety, with somewhat more than plenty for advantage: for indeed
the County of <i>Murray</i> is the most pleasantest and plentiful
country in all <i>Scotland</i>; being plain land, that a coach
may be driven more than four and thirty miles one way in it,
alongst by the sea-coast.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">From thence I went to <i>Elgin</i>
in <i>Murray</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id=
"FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class=
"fnanchor">[27]</a> an ancient City, where there stood a fair and
beautiful church with three steeples, the walls of it and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg
56]</a></span>steeples all yet standing; but the roofs, windows,
and many marble monuments and tombs of honourable and worthy
personages all broken and defaced: this was done in the time when
ruin bare rule, and Knox knocked down churches.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">From <i>Elgin</i> we went to the
Bishop of <i>Murray</i> his house which is called <i>Spiny</i>,
or <i>Spinay</i>: a Reverend Gentleman he is, of the noble name
of <i>Douglas</i>, where we were very well welcomed, as befitted
the honour of himself and his guests.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">From thence we departed to the
Lord Marquess of <i>Huntlys</i> to a sumptuous house of his,
named the <i>Bog of Geethe</i>, where our entertainment was like
himself, free, bountiful and honourable. There (after two days
stay) with much entreaty and earnest suit, I gate leave of the
Lords to depart towards <i>Edinburgh</i>: the Noble Marquess, the
Earl of <i>Mar</i>, <i>Murray</i>, <i>Enzie</i>, <i>Buchan</i>,
and the Lord <i>Erskine</i>; all these, I thank them, gave me
gold to defray my charges in my journey.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">So after five and thirty days
hunting and travel I returning, past by another stately mansion
of the Lord Marquesses, called <i>Stroboggy</i>, and so over
<i>Carny</i> mount to <i>Brechin</i>, where a wench that was born
deaf and dumb came into my chamber at midnight (I being asleep)
and she opening the bed, would feign have lodged with me: but had
I been a <i>Sardanapalus</i>, or a <i>Heliogabulus</i>, I think
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg
57]</a></span> either the great travel over the mountains had
tamed me; or if not, her beauty could never have moved me. The
best parts of her were, that her breath was as sweet as
sugar-candian,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id=
"FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class=
"fnanchor">[28]</a> being very well shouldered beneath the waste;
and as my hostess told me the next morning, that she had changed
her maiden-head for the price of a bastard not long before. But
howsoever, she made such a hideous noise, that I started out of
my sleep, and thought that the Devil had been there: but I no
sooner knew who it was, but I arose, and thrust my dumb beast out
of my chamber; and for want of a lock or a latch, I staked up my
door with a great chair.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Thus having escaped one of the
seven deadly sins as at <i>Brechin</i>, I departed from thence to
a town called <i>Forfor</i>; and from thence to <i>Dundee</i>,
and so to <i>Kinghorn</i>, <i>Burntisland</i>, and so to
<i>Edinburgh</i>, where I stayed eight days, to recover myself of
falls and bruises, which I received in my travel in the Highland
mountainous hunting. Great welcome I had showed me all my stay at
<i>Edinburgh</i>, by many worthy gentlemen, namely, old Master
<i>George Todrigg</i>, Master <i>Henry Livingston</i>, Master
<i>James Henderson</i>, Master <i>John Maxwell</i>, and a number
of others, who suffered me to want no wine or good cheer, as may
be imagined.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg
58]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Now the day before I came from
<i>Edinburgh</i>, I went to <i>Leith</i>, where I found my long
approved and assured good friend Master <i>Benjamin Jonson</i>,
at one Master <i>John Stuarts</i> house; I thank him for his
great kindness towards me: for at my taking leave of him, he gave
me a piece of gold of two and twenty shillings<a name=
"FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> to drink his health
in <i>England</i>. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id=
"Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>And withal, willed me to remember his
kind commendations to all his friends: So with a friendly
farewell, I left him as well, as I hope never to see him in a
worse estate: for he is amongst noblemen and gentlemen that know
his true worth, and their own honours, where, with much
respective love he is worthily entertained.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">So leaving <i>Leith</i> I returned
to <i>Edinburgh</i>, and within the port or gate, called the
<i>Nether-Bow</i>, I discharged my pockets of all the money I
had: and as I came pennyless within the walls of that city at my
first coming thither; so now at my departing from thence, I came
moneyless out of it again; having in company to convey me out,
certain gentlemen, amongst the which Master <i>James
Acherson</i>, Laird of <i>Gasford</i>, a gentleman that brought
me to his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id=
"Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>house, where with great entertainment
he and his good wife did welcome me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">On the morrow he sent one of his
men to bring me to a place called <i>Adam</i>, to Master <i>John
Acmootye</i> his house, one of the Grooms of his Majesty's
Bed-chamber; where with him and his two brethren, Master
<i>Alexander</i>, and Master <i>James Acmootye</i>, I found both
cheer and welcome, not inferior to any that I had had in any
former place.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Amongst our viands that we had
there, I must not forget the Sole and Goose (<i>sic</i>), a most
delicate fowl, which breeds in great abundance in a little rock
called the <i>Bass</i>, which stands two miles into the sea. It
is very good flesh, but it is eaten in the form as we eat
oysters, standing at a side-board, a little before dinner,
unsanctified without grace; and after it is eaten, it must be
well liquored with two or three good rouses<a name=
"FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> of sherry or canary
sack. The Lord or owner of the <i>Bass</i> doth profit at the
least two hundred pound yearly by those geese; the <i>Bass</i>
itself being of a great height, and near three quarters of a mile
in compass, all fully replenished with wild fowl, having but one
small entrance into it, with a house, a garden, and a chapel in
it; and on the top of it a well of pure fresh water.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">From <i>Adam</i>, Master
<i>John</i> and Master <i>James Acmootye</i> went to the town of
<i>Dunbar</i> with me, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61"
id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>where ten Scottish pints of wine
were consumed, and brought to nothing for a farewell: there at
Master <i>James Baylies</i> house I took leave, and Master
<i>James Acmootye</i> coming for <i>England</i>, said, that if I
would ride with, that neither I nor my horse should want betwixt
that place and <i>London</i>. Now I having no money nor means for
travel, began at once to examine my manners and my want: at last
my want persuaded my manners to accept of this worthy gentleman's
undeserved courtesy. So that night he brought me to a place
called <i>Cockburnspath</i>, where we lodged at an inn, the like
of which I dare say, is not in any of his Majesty's Dominions.
And for to show my thankfulness to Master <i>William Arnot</i>
and his wife, the owners thereof, I must explain their bountiful
entertainment of guests, which is this:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Suppose ten, fifteen, or twenty
men and horses come to lodge at their house, the men shall have
flesh, tame and wild fowl, fish with all variety of good cheer,
good lodging, and welcome; and the horses shall want neither hay
or provender: and at the morning at their departure the reckoning
is just nothing. This is this worthy gentlemen's use, his chief
delight being only to give strangers entertainment <i>gratis</i>:
and I am sure, that in <i>Scotland</i> beyond <i>Edinburgh</i>, I
have been at houses like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62"
id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> castles for building; the master
of the house his beaver being his blue bonnet, one that will wear
no other shirts, but of the flax that grows on his own ground,
and of his wife's, daughters', or servants' spinning; that hath
his stockings, hose, and jerkin of the wool of his own sheep's
backs; that never (by his pride of apparel) caused mercer,
draper, silk-man, embroiderer, or haberdasher to break and turn
bankrupt: and yet this plain home-spun fellow keeps and maintains
thirty, forty, fifty servants, or perhaps, more, every day
relieving three or fourscore poor people at his gate; and besides
all this, can give noble entertainment for four or five days
together to five or six earls and lords, besides knights,
gentlemen and their followers, if they be three or four hundred
men, and horse of them, where they shall not only feed but feast,
and not feast but banquet, this is a man that desires to know
nothing so much, as his duty to God and his King, whose greatest
cares are to practise the works of piety, charity, and
hospitality: he never studies the consuming art of fashionless
fashions, he never tries his strength to bear four or five
hundred acres on his back at once, his legs are always at
liberty, not being fettered with golden garters, and manacled
with artificial roses, whose weight (sometime) is the last
reliques of some decayed Lordship: Many of these<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
worthy housekeepers there are in <i>Scotland</i>, amongst some of
them I was entertained; from whence I did truly gather these
aforesaid observations.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">So leaving <i>Cockburnspath</i>,
we rode to <i>Berwick</i>, where the worthy old Soldier and
ancient Knight, Sir <i>William Bowyer</i>, made me welcome, but
contrary to his will, we lodged at an Inn, where Master <i>James
Acmootye</i> paid all charges: but at <i>Berwick</i> there was a
grievous chance happened, which I think not fit the relation to
be omitted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">In the river of <i>Tweed</i>,
which runs by <i>Berwick</i>, are taken by fishermen that dwell
there, infinite numbers of fresh salmons, so that many households
and families are relieved by the profit of that fishing; but (how
long since I know not) there was an order that no man or boy
whatsoever should fish upon a Sunday: this order continued long
amongst them, till some eight or nine weeks before Michaelmas
last, on a Sunday, the salmons played in such great abundance in
the river, that some of the fishermen (contrary to God's law and
their own order) took boats and nets and fished, and caught near
three hundred salmons; but from that time until Michaelmas day
that I was there, which was nine weeks, and heard the report of
it, and saw the poor people's miserable lamentations, they had
not seen one salmon in the river; and some of them were in
despair that they should never see any more there; affirming
it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg
64]</a></span> to be God's judgment upon them for the profanation
of the Sabbath.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">The thirtieth of September we rode
from <i>Berwick</i> to <i>Belford</i> from <i>Belford</i> to
<i>Alnwick</i>, the next day from <i>Alnwick</i> to
<i>Newcastle</i>, where I found the noble Knight, Sir <i>Henry
Witherington</i>; who, because I would have no gold nor silver,
gave me a bay mare, in requital of a loaf of bread that I had
given him two and twenty years before, at the Island of
<i>Flores</i>, of the which I have spoken before. I overtook at
<i>Newcastle</i> a great many of my worthy friends, which were
all coming for <i>London</i>, namely, Master <i>Robert Hay</i>,
and Master <i>David Drummond</i>, where I was welcomed at Master
<i>Nicholas Tempests</i> house. From <i>Newcastle</i> I rode with
those gentlemen to <i>Durham</i>, to <i>Darlington</i>, to
<i>Northallerton</i>, and to <i>Topcliffe</i> in
<i>Yorkshire</i>, where I took my leave of them, and would needs
try my pennyless fortunes by myself, and see the city of
<i>York</i>, where I was lodged at my right worshipful good
friend, Master Doctor <i>Hudson</i> one of his Majesty's
chaplains, who went with me, and shewed me the goodly Minster
Church there, and the most admirable, rare-wrought,
unfellowed<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id=
"FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class=
"fnanchor">[31]</a> chapter house.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">From <i>York</i> I rode to
<i>Doncaster</i>, where my horses were well fed at the Bear, but
myself found out the honorable Knight, Sir <i>Robert
Anstruther</i> at his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id=
"Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>father-in-law's, the truly noble Sir
<i>Robert Swifts</i> house, he being then High Sheriff of
<i>Yorkshire</i>, where with their good Ladies, and the right
Honourable the Lord <i>Sanquhar</i>, I was stayed two nights and
one day, Sir <i>Robert Anstruther</i> (I thank him) not only
paying for my two horses' meat, but at my departure, he gave me a
letter to <i>Newark</i> upon <i>Trent</i>, twenty eight miles in
my way, where Master <i>George Atkinson</i> mine host made me as
welcome, as if I had been a French Lord, and what was to be paid,
as I called for nothing, I paid as much; and left the reckoning
with many thanks to Sir <i>Robert Anstruther</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">So leaving <i>Newark</i>, with
another gentleman that overtook me, we came at night to
<i>Stamford</i>, to the sign of the Virginity (or the Maidenhead)
where I delivered a letter from the Lord <i>Sanquhar</i>; which
caused Master <i>Bates</i> and his wife, being the master and
mistress of the house, to make me and the gentleman that was with
me great cheer for nothing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">From <i>Stamford</i> the next day
we rode to <i>Huntington</i>, where we lodged at the Postmaster's
house, at the sign of the Crown; his name is <i>Riggs</i>. He was
informed who I was, and wherefore I undertook this my pennyless
progress: wherefore he came up to our chamber, and supped with
us, and very bountifully called for three quarts of wine and
sugar, and four jugs of beer. He did drink and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> begin
healths like a horse-leech and swallowed down his cups without
feeling, as if he had had the dropsy, or nine pound of sponge in
his maw. In a word, as he is a post, he drank post, striving and
calling by all means to make the reckoning great, or to make us
men of great reckoning. But in his payment he was tired like a
jade, leaving the gentleman that was with me to discharge the
terrible shot, or else one of my horses must have lain in pawn

where Master <i>Holland</i> at the Falcon, (mine old

him with, not a penny of money.</p>

<span class="smcap">Coryatizing.</span>&mdash;Thomas Coryate, an
English traveller, who called himself the "Odcombian
leg-stretcher." He was the son of the rector of Odcombe, and in
1611 published an account of his travels on the Continent with
the singular title of "Coryates Crudities. Hastily gobled up in
five Moneths travells in France, Savoy, Italy, Rhetia, commonly
called the Grisons country, Helvetia, alias Switzerland, some
parts of high Germany, and the Netherlands; Newly digested in the
hungary aire of Odcombe in the county of Somerset, and now
dispersed to the nourishment of the travelling members of this
Kingdome, &amp;c. London, printed by W. S., Anno Domini 1611."
Taylor had an especial grudge against Coryat, for having had
influence enough to procure his "Laugh and be Fat"&mdash;directed
against the traveller&mdash;to be burned; and that he never
failed to "feed fat the ancient grudge," may be seen in the many
pieces of ridicule levelled at the author of the "Crudities,"
even after his death.</p>

<span class="smcap">A Piece of Gold of Two-and-Twenty
Shillings.</span>&mdash;"This was a considerable present; but
Jonson's hand and heart were ever open to his acquaintance. All
his pleasures were social; and while health and fortune smiled
upon him, he was no niggard either of his time or talents to
those who needed them. There is something striking in Taylor's
concluding sentence, when the result of his (Jonson's) visit to
Drummond is considered:&mdash;but there is one <i>evil that
walks</i>, which keener eyes than John's have often failed to
discover.&mdash;I have only to add, in justice to this honest man
(Taylor) that his gratitude outlived the subject of it. He paid
the tribute of a verse to his benefactor's memory:&mdash;the
verse indeed, was mean: but poor Taylor had nothing better to
give."&mdash;Lt. Col. Francis Cunningham's edition of Gifford's
Ben Jonson's Works, p. xli.</p>
<p>"In the
summer of 1618 Scotland received a visit from the famous Ben
Jonson. The burly Laureate walked all the way, among the motives
for a journey then undertaken by few Englishmen, might be
curiosity regarding a country from which he knew that his family
was derived, his grandfather having been one of the Johnsons of
Annandale. He had many friends too, particularly among the
connections of the Lennox family, whom he might be glad to see at
their own houses. Among those with whom he had amicable
intercourse, was William Drummond, the poet, then in the prime of
life, and living as a bachelor in his romantic mansion of
Hawthornden, on the Esk, seven miles from Edinburgh. It is
probable that Drummond and Jonson had met before in London, and
indulged together in the "wit-combats" at the Mermaid and similar
scenes. Indeed, there is a prevalent belief in Scotland that it
was mainly to see Drummond at Hawthornden that Jonson came so far
from home, and certain it is, from Drummond's report of his
'<i>Conversations</i>,' that he designed 'to write a Fisher or
Pastoral (Piscatory?) Play&mdash;and make the stage of it on the
Lomond Lake&mdash;he also contemplated writing in prose his 'Foot
Pilgrimage to Scotland,' which, with a feeling very natural in
one who found so much to admire where so little had been known,
he spoke of entitling '<span class="smcap">A Discovery</span>.'
Unfortunately, this work, as well as a poem in which he called
Edinburgh&mdash;</p>

<p><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">'The Heart of Scotland,
Britain's other eye,'</span><br /></p>
<p>has not
been preserved to us. We can readily see that the work
contemplated must have been of a general character, from Jonson's
letters to Drummond on the subject of it. How much to be
regretted that we have not the Scotland of that day delineated by
so vigorous a pen as that of the author of
<i>Sejanual</i>"&mdash;<i>Chambers'</i> Domestic
Annals of Scotland, vol. 1.</p>
<p>Whether
Taylor's "Penniless Pilgrimage" really did interfere with, and
prevent the publication of Ben Jonson's 'Foot Pilgrimage' would
now be difficult to say. It is very evident from Taylor's remarks
in his Dedication "To all my loving adventurers, &amp;c.," he had
been accused by the critics that he "<i>did undergo this project,
either in malice, or mockage of Master Benjamin Jonson</i>." It
is quite certain that Taylor lost no time in getting his
"Pilgrimage" printed "at the charges of the author" immediately
on his return to London on the fifteenth of October 1618.</p>
